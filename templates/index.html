        <p>
          As a former wrestling captain in high school, I take pride in my strong work ethic, attention to detail, and willingness to stay humble and learn from others.
          This mindset guided me as I worked as an AI research intern at Cross Labs last summer in Japan.
          After interning abroad, I recognized that living in a new environment facilitated significant personal growth, including learning to communicate and engage with people from vastly different cultures in day-to-day life.
          Hence, I would be open to relocating to other available office locations, including international ones.

          I am a highly organized person and love learning new things.
          A few things I did for the first time in the past year include rock climbing and performing a backflip.
          If accepted to a position, I would be eager to begin learning any unfamiliar technologies or languages prior to starting the internship.
          I excel at reading documentation and independently researching new tools and technologies, enabling me to quickly grasp their essential features.
        </p>
        </p>
          I enjoy getting to know people, so feel free to reach out to me if you would like to know more about me.
